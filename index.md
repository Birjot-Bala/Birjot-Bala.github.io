**BEng, Mechanical Engineering**  
Class of 2019  
McMaster University  
Hamilton, ON  
- Graduated with distinction achieving a GPA of 3.7/4.0.
- Specialized in Thermofluids and Energy Systems.

**Relevant Technical Electives:**
- Computational Fluid Mechanics & Heat Transfer – explored the use of CFD software (ANSYS-CFX) in solving Thermal Engineering problems.
- Compressible Flow & Turbomachinery – analyzed 1-D and 2-D compressible flows, flow through axial compressors and turbine cascades, and power generation from wind turbines.
- Incompressible Flow – examined the Navier-Stokes equations, boundary layers, and airfoils.
- Thermofluids System Design & Analysis – studied the design, operation, performance, and optimization of thermofluids systems and their mechanical equipment.

**Waste Heat Recovery System Model**  
September 2018 - April 2019  
- Developed an energy model using EnergyPlus to estimate the cost savings of implementing a waste heat recovery system in a restaurant.
- Modelled and simulated daily water, electricity, and natural gas usage using Microsoft Excel and EnergyPlus implementing schedules, temperature setpoints and the Canadian Weather Year for Energy Calculations (CWEC).
- Implemented restrictions based on NFPA 96, CSA B149.1-10 and ASHRAE 90.1 to limit minimum exhaust velocity, ensure sufficient make-up air for ventilation, and meet energy standards.


**Discord Bot**  
February 2020 - Present  
- Developed a bot, in Python, for a Discord server using open APIs.
- Listens for commands and retrieves information from API endpoints based on user input.
- Makes use of libraries such as requests, discord.py, pytest, and matplotlib.
